= 7. Course Maintenance

This section outlines the process of ongoing maintenance of published courses.

== Ongoing Maintenance of Quick Courses

The *main* branch always contains the latest published content for a course. For content updates, bug fixes and other enhancements to existing content, follow the same process you used for contributing to a new course.

1. Ensure that you switch to the *main* branch. Fetch the latest changes to the *main* branch.
+
```sh
$ git checkout main
$ git pull
```

2. Create a new branch based on the latest contents from *main*.
+
```sh
$ git checkout -b <branch_name>
```
3. Make your content changes and then push them to GitHub.
+
Follow the steps listed in the xref:review.adoc[Content Review] and xref:publish.adoc[Publishing Content] sections to create a PR, get it reviewed, and then merge your PR back into *main* to publish the updated content to the production website.
