= 4. Creating Content

You should have received commit access to the quick course(s) GitHub repository that you are contributing to.

You will start off by cloning the source code from GitHub locally on your workstation.

== Clone Source Code

Clone the Git repository for a quick course to a folder of your choice. For the following steps in this guide, this folder is indicated by *$CONTENT_ROOT*:

```sh
git clone <quick course git url>
```

Identify the quick course git url by navigating to the GitHub repository for the quick course and then click on the green *<> Code* to expand it

Copy and paste the URL in the *git clone* command and hit enter.

This command should download a copy of the latest source code tree for the quick course.

The source code tree contains a number of configuration files and Antora specific directory structure that is optimized for simplicity and ease of quick course authoring.

Each quick course repository contains a *README.md* at the root of the source code tree. Inspect it to understand how to work with the asciidoc source.

== Install Antora and Other Development Tools

* Navigate to the folder where you cloned the source code for the quick course (*$CONTENT_ROOT*) from the command line terminal:

```sh
$ cd $CONTENT_ROOT
```

* Run **npm install** to install Antora and other development tools

```sh
$ npm install
```

== Editing Asciidoc Source

The Git repository contains the default chapter and section stubs with comments from the course product owner and architect to help guide you. Inspect the *$CONTENT_ROOT/antora.yml* file, which defines the top level modules (chapters) in this course. 

The starting point (index page) for the course is rendered from asciidoc content in the *modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc* file.

Each top level module has a separate asciidoc file (*nav.adoc*) located in *modules/module_name/* folder. The *nav.adoc* lists the sections that make up the chapter/module.

== Create a Local Git Branch

*TODO*: This entire section could use a lot of screenshots for the newbie user.

It is a Git best practice to make changes in a local Git *branch*, get the contents in the branch reviewed by your peers or the product owner/architect, and then merge your changes to the *main* branch, from which the HTML is rendered to the production website.

Before you make any changes, create a local Git branch:

```sh
$ git checkout -b my_local_branch
```

Ensure that you use an appropriate branch name to easily identify your changes. *ch02s03*, *rhods_pipelines_lecture*, *bug_fix_issue_496* are good branch names. *mybranch*, *changes*, *hello123* are not.

You are now ready to start making changes.

To write narrative and hands-on lab content, edit the asciidoc files under *$CONTENT_ROOT/modules/module_name/pages*. You can use the *asciidoctor* plug-in preview plugin (Press **"Ctrl + Shift + V"** on Linux; Press **"Cmd + Shift + V"** on MacOS) to preview the rendered HTML content.

== Previewing Generated HTML

To preview the rendered website as it would look for end-users consuming this content, do the following:

* Run the **npm run watch:adoc** command to automatically detect changes to your asciidoc content and invoke the Antora HTML generator:

```bash
$ npm run watch:adoc
```

Keep this terminal open as long as you are editing the asciidoc source code.

* In another terminal window, run the **npm run serve** command that starts a local web server that serves the generated HTML content:

```bash
$ npm run serve
```
You will be shown the local URL (http://127.0.0.1:8080) where you can view the rendered content. Open the link in a web browser.

Keep making changes in your asciidoc source files. The **npm watch** command will automatically detect your changes and re-generate the HTML content. Refresh your web browser to view the updated content.

Keep this terminal open as long as you want to preview the generated HTML content.

Once you are satisfied with your changes, you can close both terminal windows by pressing (**Ctrl + c**).

NOTE: Automatic detection of asciidoc source code changes and HTML regeneration sometimes fails (for example, when your workstation goes to sleep or suspend mode). In such a scenario, press **Ctrl + c** in both terminal windows and restart the npm commands.
