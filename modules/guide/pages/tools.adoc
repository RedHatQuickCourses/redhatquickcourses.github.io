= 3. Development Tooling

*Antora*, our publishing system that converts asciidoc source to HTML, is based on the *Node.js* runtime.

You need to install Node.js on your local workstation, and perform several steps to configure a development environment.

== Install Node.js

On mac OS, install node using *homebrew*:

```sh
brew install node
```

On Fedora and RHEL based systems, use *dnf*:

```sh
sudo dnf install nodejs
```

On Ubuntu and Windows WSL2, use *apt*:

```sh
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

== Install Visual Studio Code

You can use any editor or IDE to edit asciidoc source code. However, we recommend *Visual Studio Code* for working on quick courses.

Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and install Visual Studio Code for your platform.
