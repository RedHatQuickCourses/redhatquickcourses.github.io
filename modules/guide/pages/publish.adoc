= 6. Publishing Content

Content in the production website is updated only with changes from the *main* branch. You need to merge the changes in your pull request into *main* after the PR is approved.

A GitHub automated job (GitHub Action) runs on every merge in the **main** branch and publishes the updated HTML content to the production website.

1. You should get an email notification after a reviewer approves your PR or requests more changes in the content.

2. Navigate to the PR details page and inspect the comments from the reviewer (if any) and verify that the PR is approved.
If there are changes needed, then make these changes in the *same* branch that you created the PR for and push the changes to GitHub.
Request a re-review of the new changes from the reviewer.

3. After your PR is approved, you should merge the PR into the *main* branch.

5. A GitHub action should automatically run after the merge to rebuild the HTML pages for the production website.
Click on the `Actions` tab in the GitHub repository page for the course and verify that the GitHub action was successful.
