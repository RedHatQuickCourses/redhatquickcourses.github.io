= 5. Content Review

After you have pushed your local branch changes to GitHub, it is a good practice to get your changes reviewed by someone in the PTL team before the changes are actually published on the website.

== Create Pull Request (PR)

1. Navigate to the quick course GitHub repository using a web browser. You should see a notification that a new branch was pushed, and you will be prompted to create a *Pull Request (PR)*.

Click the green `Compare & pull request` button to create a pull request.

2. Select a reviewer (most often someone from the PTL team) from the `Reviewers` field. Leave a descriptive comment about the change and ensure that you have selected `main` as the branch you want to merge your changes into.

Click the `Create pull request` button to create the pull request. Your PR will be reviewed and you will receive an email notification informing you if the PR was approved, or if further changes are required.
