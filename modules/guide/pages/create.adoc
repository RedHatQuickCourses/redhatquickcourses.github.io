= 4. Creating Content

You should have received commit access to the quick course(s) GitHub repository that you are contributing to.

You will start off by cloning the source code from GitHub locally on your workstation.

== Clone Source Code

1. Identify the quick course git url by navigating to the GitHub repository for the quick course and then click on the green *< > Code* button to expand it
+

+
Copy the SSH URL of the GitHub repository for the next step.

2. Clone the Git repository for a quick course to a folder of your choice. For the following steps in this guide, this folder is indicated by *$CONTENT_ROOT*:

   $ git clone <quick course git url>
+
Paste the URL of the Git repository you copied in the previous step. This command should download a copy of the latest source code tree for the quick course.

3. The source code tree contains a number of configuration files and Antora specific directory structure that is optimized for simplicity and ease of quick course authoring.

== Install Antora and Other Development Tools

1. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the source code for the quick course (*$CONTENT_ROOT*) from the command line terminal:

   $ cd $CONTENT_ROOT

2. Run **npm install** to install Antora and other development tools

   $ npm install

== Editing Asciidoc Source

The Git repository contains the default chapter and section stubs with comments from the course product owner and architect to help guide you. 

1. Inspect the *$CONTENT_ROOT/antora.yml* file. The list under the `nav` key defines the top level modules (chapters) in this course.
This file also contains some basic metadata (name, title and version) about this quick course. 
+   
```yaml
name: hello
title: Hello
version: 1
nav:
- modules/ROOT/nav.adoc
- modules/chapter1/nav.adoc
- modules/chapter2/nav.adoc
- modules/chapter3/nav.adoc
- modules/appendix/nav.adoc
```
2. Antora (our publishing system) looks for asciidoc source file under the `$CONTENT_ROOT/modules` folder.
Each top level chapter in the quick course is a unique folder under the `modules` folder.
+
By convention, the entry point for each module is named `nav.adoc` and is located in the `$CONTENT_ROOT/modules/module_name` folder. This file lists the sections in the chapter.
+   
```asciidoc
* xref:index.adoc[]
** xref:section1.adoc[]
** xref:section2.adoc[]
** xref:section3.adoc[]
```
+
As a convention, the home page for a chapter is a file named `index.adoc`. The sections in a chapter are listed as nested entries under `index.adoc`.

3. The entry/starting point for the course is always called the `ROOT` module (the folder should be called `ROOT` under the `modules` folder), and is rendered from asciidoc content in the *$CONTENT_ROOT/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc* file.

4. Image files for a chapter are stored in the *$CONTENT_ROOT/modules/<module_name>/images* folder. You can then reference the image files in asciidoc source using the `image::` attribute:
+   
```asciidoc
image::image.png[title="caption/title for image"]
```

== Create a Local Git Branch

It is a Git best practice to make changes in a local Git *branch*, and then get the contents in the branch reviewed by your peers or the product owner/architect.
Finally, merge your changes to the *main* branch, from which the HTML is rendered to the production website.

1. Before you make any changes, create a local Git branch and switch to it. From the *$CONTENT_ROOT* folder, run the `git branch` command:
+
```sh
$ git checkout -b rsriniva/index_page_update
Switched to a new branch 'rsriniva/index_page_update'
```
+
NOTE: It is a good practice to prefix the branch name with your GitHub ID or a string that uniquely identifies you. 
+
Ensure that you use an appropriate branch name to easily identify your changes. *ch02s03*, *rhods_pipelines_lecture*, *bug_fix_issue_496* are good branch names. *mybranch*, *changes*, *hello123* are not.
+
You are now ready to start making changes.

2. To add a new chapter to the course create a new folder under the `$CONTENT_ROOT/modules` directory and name it appropriately. Then, create the `nav.adoc` under the new module directory, followed by the `pages` and `images` folder. Add new sections for the chapter by creating new asciidoc files under the `pages` directory.

To write narrative and hands-on lab content, edit the asciidoc files under *$CONTENT_ROOT/modules/module_name/pages*. You can use the *asciidoctor* preview plug-in (Press **"Ctrl + Shift + V"** on Linux; Press **"Cmd + Shift + V"** on macOS) to preview the rendered HTML content.

NOTE: The asciidoctor preview plugin does not show the actual rendered UI as seen by a student taking the course. It should be used as development tool to get a rough structural preview of the content.

== Previewing Generated HTML

To preview the rendered website as it would look for end-users consuming this content, do the following:

1. Run the **npm run watch:adoc** command from the `$CONTENT_ROOT` folder to automatically detect changes to your asciidoc content and invoke the Antora HTML generator:
+
```bash
$ npm run watch:adoc
> watch:adoc
> watch 'npx antora antora-playbook.yml' ./modules

> Watching ./modules
Site generation complete!
...
```
+
Keep this terminal open as long as you are editing the asciidoc source code.

2. In another terminal window, run the **npm run serve** command from the `$CONTENT_ROOT` folder that starts a local web server that serves the generated HTML content:
+
```bash
$ npm run serve
> serve
> npx http-server build/site -c-1

Starting up http-server, serving build/site
...
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
...
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```
You will be shown the local URL (http://127.0.0.1:8080) where you can view the rendered content. Open the link in a web browser.

3. Keep making changes in your asciidoc source files. The **npm watch** command will automatically detect your changes and re-generate the HTML content. Refresh your web browser to view the updated content.

Keep this terminal open as long as you want to preview the generated HTML content.

Once you are satisfied with your changes, you can close both terminal windows by pressing (**Ctrl + c**).

NOTE: Automatic detection of asciidoc source code changes and HTML regeneration sometimes fails (for example, when your workstation goes to sleep or suspend mode). In such a scenario, press **Ctrl + c** in both terminal windows and restart the npm commands.

== Commit and Push Branch Changes

After you are satisfied with how the HTML content is rendered locally in your workspace, you can commit your changes to your local branch.

1. First, confirm that you are currently in your local branch, and not in *main*.
+
```sh
$ git branch
  main
* rsriniva/index_page_update
```
+
NOTE: The `*` before the branch name in the output of `git branch` indicates the current "active" branch.

+
Then, view and confirm all your changes:
+
```sh
$ git status
On branch rsriniva/index_page_update
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

2. Add all the files you want to commit to the branch.
+
```sh
$ git add .
```

3. Commit your changes.
+
```sh
$ git commit -m "updated course index page"
```

4. Push your local branch to GitHub. This command will create a new branch in the course GitHub repository.
+
```sh
$ git push -u origin rsriniva/index_page_update
...
