The quick courses use standard asciidoc for content authoring, which is then rendered to HTML and hosted by GitHub Pages. We use the Antora publishing platform (https://antora.org) to transform the asciidoc content to HTML.

To contribute, you need the following:

* You have a mac OS or Linux workstation to work with the asciidoc source. *Windows is not supported*, but you can try running WSL2 based Linux environments.
* You must be familiar with using command line interfaces (terminal/shell) to install development tools, and to run commands.
* You must be familiar with using Git (and specifically GitHub) for source code version control.
* A GitHub account. If you do not have one, go to https://github.com and click on the `Sign up` button in the top right corner.
* A basic understanding and familiarity with asciidoc (https://asciidoc.org/) to write technical documentation.
